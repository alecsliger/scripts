# Scripts
General use scripts and shortcuts


## Linux

*grepip.sh*
Pipe this into a concatenated file to grab anything that looks like an IP address. It can technically return invalid IP's too but it 'just works' _-Todd Howard_



*scp.sh*
I personally hate the scp syntax so I made this to avoid using it entirely. The best way to use it is to make a copy of the script for each server you intend on establishing a copy relationship with, and editing the OPTIONS lines accordingly.



## Windows

*MoveSubfilesToMain.bat*
